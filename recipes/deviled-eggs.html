    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These deviled eggs made with Worcestershire sauce and horseradish appeared on the table at every holiday 
        and other gathering when I was growing up. My children will stand in front of the refrigerator and eat 
        one after another — if I don't catch them! You can spice these up with Creole-style or country mustard, 
        a few dashes (or more!) of hot sauce, and a sprig of parsley. 
        They're just pretty!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cream-style horseradish sauce</li>
        <li>1 drop hot pepper sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes, for garnish</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and cover with water by 1 inch. 
            Cover the saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and let eggs stand in 
            hot water for 15 minutes. Drain and cool under cold running water in the sink.</li>
        <li>Peel cool eggs and cut in half lengthwise. Place yolks into a mixing bowl and set whites aside. 
            Mash yolks with a fork until smooth; stir in mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. 
            Spoon yolk mixture into a heavy plastic bag; snip a corner off the bag to create a 1/2-inch opening. Pipe yolk mixture into egg white halves. Chill for at least 30 minutes before serving. 
            Sprinkle with parsley and paprika to garnish.</li>
    </ol>
